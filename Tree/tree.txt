**Tree

1)Node: contains data and links to the nodes that is the children of this Node
2)Edges: the link between any two nodes
3)Root: the top most node of a tree (the most important node)
4)Height = Depth

5)Internal Nodes: the nodes that has at least one child (parent node)
6)External Nodes/leaf Nodes: the node that has no child (child node)

**Tree traversal
Traversing a tree: preorder, inorder, postorder

1) preorder
-Print the parent node(current node)
-Print the left most child
-Print the remaining children of this node(print the right child/print the right sub tree)
2) inorder
-Print the left most child
-Print the parent node
-Print the remaining children of this node from left to right
3) postorder
-Print the left most child
-Print the remaining children from left to right of this node
-Print the parent node
